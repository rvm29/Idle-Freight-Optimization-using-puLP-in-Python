Tata Steel is a Steel Manufacturing company, which produces Steel in the form of both Flat Products [Steel Slabs, Hot Rolled Coils (HR), Cold Rolled Coils (CR), Sheets etc.] and
Long Products (Steel Billets, TMT Bars, Wire Rods etc.). Flat products accounts for ~70% of the total mix. These Steel products are sent to customers using both Rail and Road 
Transportation, where Rail transportation accounts for ~60% of dispatches. Railway wagons provided by the Indian Railways for steel transportation generally comes in three sizes,
63 Tons, 66 Tons and 69 Tons. In case of Flat Products, the coil sizes generally range from 20 tons to 24 tons. As such, the best combination of wagon and coils has to be used,
in order to minimize the Idle Freight.
